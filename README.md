Text Adventure Game Development

In this assignment, students are tasked with designing a text-based adventure gameLinks to an external site.. This game should utilize the Python essentials covered thus far, including, but not limited to:

Strings and String Manipulation
User-Defined Functions and Objects (variables)
User Input and Input Handling
Conditional and Nested Conditional Statements (if/elif/else)
Loops (for/while)
Controlling for Errors (try/except)
 

The working version of the game includes:

a game that can be successfully completed within a maximum of 3 minutes (i.e., you can win the game in 3 minutes or less)
for a passing grade, your text adventure game must include a minimum of:
3 stages (maximum of 5 stages)
5 defined variables
1 list
1 for loop
1 while loop
3 nested conditional statements (all must include an else clause)
1 win() function (Executed whenever a user wins the game. There must be only one win function)
1 fail() function (Executed whenever a user loses the game. There must be only one fail function)
